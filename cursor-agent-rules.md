# Comprehensive Cursor Agent Rules

## Introduction
This document defines universal rules and guardrails for Cursor AI agents, designed to work across different projects and technology stacks. These rules should be stored in your project's `.cursor/rules` directory (newer approach) or as a `.cursorrules` file in the project root (legacy approach) to ensure consistent AI behavior across your development workflow. These guidelines help maintain quality and consistency while allowing the AI to adapt to specific requirements.

## Implementation Guide

To implement these rules in your Cursor environment:

1. **For modern Cursor versions (recommended):**
   Create the rules in `.cursor/rules/` directory using the `.mdc` format for different rule types:
   - Auto-attached rules (automatically applied to matching files)
   - Agent-requested rules (available on demand)
   - Always-applied rules (global for the project)

2. **For legacy support:**
   Create a `.cursorrules` file in the project root.

Example implementation in the newer format:

# Universal Development Standards

## Core Principles
- Prioritize object-oriented design with proper class structures and relationships
- Write clean, efficient, and maintainable code following SOLID principles
- Follow industry best practices for each language and framework
- Consider performance and security in all implementations

## Code Quality Standards
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility  
- Implement proper error handling and input validation
- Write code that is self-documenting where possible
- Follow consistent formatting and style conventions

## Microservice Architecture
- Organize code using feature folder structure
- Each feature should contain controller, service, routes, and repository (if needed)
- Follow existing patterns when adding new endpoints
- Verify linting and compilation after making changes
```

For language or framework-specific rules, create additional rule files that apply only to relevant file types.

## Global User Rules Example

For your global User Rules in Cursor Settings, consider a simplified version focusing on universal principles:

```
# Universal Development Standards

- Consider performance and security

## Microservice Standards
- Use feature folder structure for new endpoints
- Include controller, service, routes, repository components

```

## Best Practices for Rule Management

1. **Start with core principles** that apply universally
2. **Add specialized rules** for specific technologies as needed
3. **Keep rules concise** - under 500 lines per rule file
4. **Update rules** as best practices evolve
5. **Use agent feedback** to refine rules over time
